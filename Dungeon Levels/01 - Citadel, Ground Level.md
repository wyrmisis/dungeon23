## Room Keys

### 1. Southern Entrance

>[!tldr] Room Details
>* See: **Southern doors** blasted into the room; thick blue-green **vines** choke the space and **hang from most surfaces**
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Hear: **Insects**; subdued **respiration**, like the halls beyond are breathing

This room was the first entrance built for the Citadel, and historically the grandest. Now, the southern entrance serves as an alarm system for the [[The Court of Briars]], thanks to the Sentinel Creeper spread throughout the room.

The northeastern stairs are collapsed.

> [!danger] Trap: Sentinel Creeper
> * If **harmed or touched** by a living being, **alerts nearby Court of Briars guards** 
> * Roll **2d6 under Dexterity** to navigate safely


### 2. The Pillars of Elfinkind

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Four **pillars** carved in the dwarven style. Each depicts an elf (see below); **moss**.
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Feel: Humidity; a gentle, cool, stale breeze from the north. 

The pillars in this room were gifts from the dwarves of the Titan's Teeth mountain range, given in commemoration of the fulfillment of an ancient oath. Each represents an elven Paragon -- that is, an archetype that elves strive to embody in their day to day lives. Each pillar has a recess carved into it at about a meter up where an offering could fit.

The Paragons are as follows:

#### The Scholar
*A robed figure with arms tucked into sleeves. Scrolls are pinned between its arm and torso.* 
* **Accepted offering**: Texts containing ancient lore and secrets
* **Reward**: An augured answer to a question, delivered to the donor telepathically. If the question is about something deep in the dungeon, then the answer should become equally cryptic. This holds true until Level 07, at which point the "answers" become a maddening silence that inflicts 3d6 damage and stuns the donor for 1d4 turns.
* **Frequency**: Once per month per character

#### The Seneschal
*A finely dressed figure holding a delicate sabre, tip planted into its plinth.*
* **Accepted offering**: Currency, at least 1000gp worth.
* **Reward**: Half as much XP
* **Frequency**: Once per month per character

#### The Survivor
*A muscular, stern-eyed survivalist. They stand at attention with a spear in one hand*
* **Accepted offering**: A +2 or better weapon
* **Reward**: A permanent +1 to hit and +1 damage with either missile or melee weapons, depending on the sacrificed weapon.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

#### The Spellweaver
*A robed figure clutching a staff.*
* **Accepted offering**: An arcane spell scroll of 4th level or higher
* **Reward**: A runic brand that confers a stronger connection with the Arcane.
    * A Magic-User, Elf, or Illusionist donor will gain an additional level 1 spell slot per day.
    * Others receive a single level 1 arcane spell slot that can only be used with a randomly rolled Magic-User spell.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

### 3. The Well Chamber, Level 01

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: a gaping **hole in the ceiling and floor**, 20ft diameter; shaped metal **sconces** along the walls at regular intervals, **sunlight** from above, lush **vegetation** 
> * Smell: **an underground staleness**
> * Feel: a gentle, cool, stale breeze from the well.

This is the Well Chamber for this level. The Well is a major feature of the dungeon, and works as such:
* The Well is the primary vertical "highway" for the dungeon, and provides a level-to-level "checkpoint" for adventurers.
* An individual can only travel to a lower or upper level if they have entered the Well Chamber for that level and observed the well.
* If the Well Chamber of the next level down hasn't been observed, any object placed over the Well will disappear as soon as it is no longer perceived by anyone.
* Falling into the well is to fall into oblivion; there will be no body to recover, no matter how deeply the adventurers delve.

Random encounters do not happen here. This specific Well Chamber is avoided by the Court of Briars, after a few too many Thorned Bones fell into the Well. While their corporeal forms are disposable, the Well also devours the souls of those who fall into it. Souls are the only finite resource of the Court of Briars, and are safeguarded when at all possible.

> [!question] Secret Door 
> * Southeastern wall
> * Opens from the west by pulling a sconce down
> * Opens from the east by pulling a handle on the door

### 4. Hall of Vines and Bones

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: A pair of **pillars** carved to appear to be wrapped in ivy; blue-green **vines** and **bones** in a thick carpet on the floor
> * Smell: **earthy**, **musty**, the odor of the **grave**
> * Hear: a gentle, cool, stale **breeze** from the south, an occasional **rustling** from the vines and bones.

This room is a later addition to the Citadel, built when the first level of the Proving Grounds was excavated. It is currently used by the Court of Briars as a guard post. The "guards", a pack of thorned bones, are not populated with souls (and thus, not animated) until the trap in this room is tripped.

> [!danger] Trap: Sentinel Creeper
> * If **harmed or touched** by a living being, **awakens the Thorned Bones**  in this room 
> * Roll **2d6 under Dexterity** to navigate safely

> [!info] Inhabitants (if Sentinel Creeper is tripped)
> * 8 Thorned Bones

### 5. Northern Entrance

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: **vines** cover the room; a choking mass of **vegetation** in various states of decomposition that blocks the south corridor; **corpses** embedded in the vegetation in various stages of decomposition 
> * Smell: **Rotting vegetation**, **decomposing flesh**
> * Hear: **Insects**, a subdued **stretching** and **creaking** from inside the vines

> [!danger] Trap: Grasping Wall
> * Grabs a **living creature** that comes within **10ft** from north or south
> * 3d6 under STR to escape, once per turn
> * AC 7 (12), 10hp damage with a cutting weapon to free someone
> * Disabled by destroying its root bulb, found in [[02 - Citadel, Lower Level]]

> [!example]  Treasure
> * 129gp, 226sp, 249cp on the corpses in the vines, from the north
> * A small pouch full of gems (7x 50gp gems, 3x 100gp gems), from the south. It's clutched in the hand of a dead adventurer whose arm pokes out of the wall.
> * An heirloom elvish **heartseeker spear** (spear +1, +2 when thrown) tangled deep inside the vines (must first disable the wall)
> * Two scrying mirrors on the east wall, trapped beneath the vines. Their matches are in **1-6b**. Each coupled set is worth 1000g, and weighs 400 coins per mirror. 
> * Two inactive scrying mirrors on the west wall, trapped beneath the vines. Their matches in **1-6a** were destroyed. Each uncoupled mirror is worth 20g, and weighs 400 coins per mirror. 


### 6. Northern Guard Posts

>[!tldr] Room Details (a)
> * See: a **collapsed chamber** 
> * Hear: trickling **water** from above

>[!tldr] Room Details (b)
> * See: decayed **racks of polearms**;  dust-covered, frameless **glass panes** that depict darkness
> * Hear: trickling **water** from above

These guard posts were similar in construction, contents, and purpose: smaller chambers where guards would stand watch, observing the northern entrance through scrying mirrors.

While the mirrors in **1-6a** were destroyed when the floor above collapsed, the mirrors in **1-6b** are still intact. Unfortunately, their opposites are trapped beneath the vines covering the walls of **1-5**. Destroying the grasping wall's root bulb would free the mirrors.

Clearing the rubble in **1-6a** will provide an alternate route to the upper level, though the floor is weakened significantly by the collapse; there's a 1-in-6 chance that carrying more than 1000 coins of weight into the room will cause the floor to collapse into the lower level.

> [!example]  Treasure (b)
> * A mildewed linen mural depicting the construction of the Citadel, worth 375gp to a historian or collector if restored. It weighs 150 coins.
> * Two scrying mirrors on the west wall. Their matches are in **1-5**. Each coupled set is worth 1000g, and weighs 400 coins per mirror. 


### 7. Shrine to the Paragons

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: four **bas reliefs**, three of which are damaged beyond recovery; a filthy, though otherwise intact **cushion**; an **altar** with an empty ceramic **plate**. 
> * Smell: **Dust**; long-burnt-away **incense**.

This room is a small shrine to the Elven Paragons (see **1-2**). Each bas relief is a 10ft square placed on the eastern and western walls, and three of them have been damaged to the point of being unrecognizable. Only one sculpture remains intact, that of *The Scholar*. 

The intact relief depicts the Scholar accepting a tablet from a group of younger elves, and offering a scroll in return. The relief does not contain any words.

This relief is meant to serve as a hint for players: give the scholar old lore, and they may give you knowledge in return.

> [!example]  Treasure
> * A filthy, but otherwise fine cushion. It has been enchanted to never decay. Worth 50g to a human of means, but fairly commonplace in elven society.


### 8. Overgrown Gardens

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Lush, wild, untamed **gardens**; **sunlight** from above that simulates a midsummer's day/night cycle 
> * Smell: Rotting **vegetation**; mildew and mold
> * Hear: Dripping **water**; buzzing insects
> * Feel: Humid **warmth**, regardless of time of year

To alleviate potential crises of morale among those stationed at the Citadel, elven magicks and dwarven engineering were combined to create the everlasting gardens found throughout the first level of the Citadel.  

The "sunlight" in this room is a permutation of a *Continual Light* spell devised to impart the benefits of the sun's rays. The water that intermittently sprays the garden beds from above and below comes from a network of cisterns in [[02 - Citadel, Lower Level]], which are plumbed through mythril pipes. 

Magic-users, druids, and the like will find no shortage of reagents in the gardens. However, random encounters have a 3-in-6 chance of surprising the party in a garden, due to the untamed growth.

### 9.  Privy

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Creeping **vines** bursting from multiple stone seats; stone washing **basins** fed with water from mythril **faucets**; splinters of rotting **wood**
> * Smell: **Earthy**; hint of underground **staleness**
> * Hear: Dripping **water**

There are four stone toilets here, once divided by wooden partition walls and sectioned off with wooden doors. Each toilet is plumbed with clay pipes, which were configured to direct waste to a septic system in [[02 - Citadel, Lower Level]]. 

Vines from the grasping wall (see [[#5. Northern Entrance]]) have penetrated into this room, and will grab any who come near. They are weaker than the vines in the main wall body. If the root bulb is destroyed, part of the floor will cave in, providing another route to the ground level.

> [!danger] Trap: Grasping Vessel
> * Grabs a **living creature** that comes within **5ft** of a toilet
> * 2d6 under STR to escape, once per turn
> * AC 7 (12), 10hp damage with a cutting weapon to free someone
> * Disabled by destroying its root bulb, found in [[02 - Citadel, Lower Level]]

### 10. Research Station

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Tattered and aged **parchment**; stone **desks** and **seats**; a pair of **corpses**, their bones showing signs of humanoid **bites**
> * Smell: Choking **dust**
> * Feel: A persistent **wrongness**

This hidden room was used by elven arcanists to monitor the Well.

## Loot spread, from ChatGPT:
```
In the Basic/Expert Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, the distribution of loot in a dungeon is generally based on the challenge level of the creatures and encounters within it. More powerful and difficult encounters should yield better loot as a reward for the players.

In this particular dungeon, you could consider the following spread of loot:

-   Gold, jewelry, and gems: These could be found in a variety of locations, including the treasure hoard, the ancient burial chamber, and perhaps even the throne room. The amount of gold and treasure found should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Magic items: Magic items should be more rare and valuable, and could be found in locations such as the ritual chamber, the chamber of arcane power, and perhaps even hidden within traps or puzzles. The type and power of the magic items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Art objects and other valuable items: These could be found in locations such as the library, the throne room, and the ancient burial chamber. The value and rarity of these items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    

It's important to keep in mind that the distribution of loot should be balanced and make sense within the context of the dungeon and its theme. Players should feel rewarded for their efforts, but the loot should also be challenging to obtain and fit within the story of the dungeon.
