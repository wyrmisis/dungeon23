Loot spread, from ChatGPT:
```
In the Basic/Expert Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, the distribution of loot in a dungeon is generally based on the challenge level of the creatures and encounters within it. More powerful and difficult encounters should yield better loot as a reward for the players.

In this particular dungeon, you could consider the following spread of loot:

-   Gold, jewelry, and gems: These could be found in a variety of locations, including the treasure hoard, the ancient burial chamber, and perhaps even the throne room. The amount of gold and treasure found should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Magic items: Magic items should be more rare and valuable, and could be found in locations such as the ritual chamber, the chamber of arcane power, and perhaps even hidden within traps or puzzles. The type and power of the magic items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Art objects and other valuable items: These could be found in locations such as the library, the throne room, and the ancient burial chamber. The value and rarity of these items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    

It's important to keep in mind that the distribution of loot should be balanced and make sense within the context of the dungeon and its theme. Players should feel rewarded for their efforts, but the loot should also be challenging to obtain and fit within the story of the dungeon.
