## Room Keys

### 1. Southern Entrance

>[!tldr] Room Details
>* See: **Southern doors** blasted into the room; thick blue-green **vines** choke the space and **hang from most surfaces**
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Hear: **Insects**; subdued **respiration**, like the halls beyond are breathing

This room was the first entrance built for the Citadel, and historically the grandest. Now, the southern entrance serves as an alarm system for the [[The Court of Briars]], thanks to the Sentinel Creeper spread throughout the room.

The northeastern stairs are collapsed.

> [!danger] Trap: Sentinel Creeper
> * If **harmed or touched** by a living being, **alerts nearby Court of Briars guards** 
> * Roll **2d6 under Dexterity** to navigate safely


### 2. The Pillars of Elfinkind

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Four **pillars** carved in the dwarven style. Each depicts an elf (see below); **moss**.
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Feel: Humidity; a gentle, cool, stale breeze from the north. 

The pillars in this room were gifts from the dwarves of the Titan's Teeth mountain range, given in commemoration of the fulfillment of an ancient oath. Each represents an elven Paragon -- that is, an archetype that elves strive to embody in their day to day lives. Each pillar has a recess carved into it at about a meter up where an offering could fit.

The Paragons are as follows:

#### The Scholar
*A robed figure with arms tucked into sleeves. Scrolls are pinned between its arm and torso.* 
* **Accepted offering**: Texts containing ancient lore and secrets
* **Reward**: An augured answer to a question, delivered to the donor telepathically. If the question is about something deep in the dungeon, then the answer should become equally cryptic. This holds true until Level 07, at which point the "answers" become a maddening silence that inflicts 3d6 damage and stuns the donor for 1d4 turns.
* **Frequency**: Once per month per character

#### The Seneschal
*A finely dressed figure holding a delicate sabre, tip planted into its plinth.*
* **Accepted offering**: Currency, at least 1000gp worth.
* **Reward**: Half as much XP
* **Frequency**: Once per month per character

#### The Survivor
*A muscular, stern-eyed survivalist. They stand at attention with a spear in one hand*
* **Accepted offering**: A +2 or better weapon
* **Reward**: A permanent +1 to hit and +1 damage with either missile or melee weapons, depending on the sacrificed weapon.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

#### The Spellweaver
*A robed figure clutching a staff.*
* **Accepted offering**: An arcane spell scroll of 4th level or higher
* **Reward**: A runic brand that confers a stronger connection with the Arcane.
    * A Magic-User, Elf, or Illusionist donor will gain an additional level 1 spell slot per day.
    * Others receive a single level 1 arcane spell slot that can only be used with a randomly rolled Magic-User spell.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

### 3. The Well Chamber, Level 01

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: a gaping **hole in the ceiling and floor**, 20ft diameter
> * Smell: **an underground staleness**.
> * Feel: a gentle, cool, stale breeze from the well.

This is the Well Chamber for this level. The Well is a major feature of the dungeon, and works as such:
* The Well is the primary vertical "highway" for the dungeon, and provides a level-to-level "checkpoint" for adventurers.
* An individual can only travel to a lower or upper level if they have entered the Well Chamber for that level and observed the well.
* If the Well Chamber of the next level down hasn't been observed, any object placed over the Well will disappear as soon as it is no longer perceived by anyone.
* Falling into the well is to fall into oblivion; there will be no body to recover, no matter how deeply the adventurers delve.

This specific Well Chamber is avoided by the Court of Briars, after a few too many Thorned Bones fell into the Well. While their corporeal forms are disposable, the Well also devours the souls of those who fall into it. Souls are the only finite resource of the Court of Briars, and are safeguarded when at all possible.

## Loot spread, from ChatGPT:
```
In the Basic/Expert Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, the distribution of loot in a dungeon is generally based on the challenge level of the creatures and encounters within it. More powerful and difficult encounters should yield better loot as a reward for the players.

In this particular dungeon, you could consider the following spread of loot:

-   Gold, jewelry, and gems: These could be found in a variety of locations, including the treasure hoard, the ancient burial chamber, and perhaps even the throne room. The amount of gold and treasure found should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Magic items: Magic items should be more rare and valuable, and could be found in locations such as the ritual chamber, the chamber of arcane power, and perhaps even hidden within traps or puzzles. The type and power of the magic items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Art objects and other valuable items: These could be found in locations such as the library, the throne room, and the ancient burial chamber. The value and rarity of these items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    

It's important to keep in mind that the distribution of loot should be balanced and make sense within the context of the dungeon and its theme. Players should feel rewarded for their efforts, but the loot should also be challenging to obtain and fit within the story of the dungeon.
