## Room Keys

### 1. Southern Entrance

>[!tldr] Room Details
>* See: **Southern doors** blasted into the room; thick blue-green **vines** choke the space and **hang from most surfaces**
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Hear: **Insects**; subdued **respiration**, like the halls beyond are breathing

This room was the first entrance built for the Citadel, and historically the grandest. Now, the southern entrance serves as an alarm system for the [[The Court of Briars]], thanks to the Sentinel Creeper spread throughout the room.

The northeastern stairs are collapsed.

> [!danger] Trap: Sentinel Creeper
> * If **harmed or touched** by a living being, **alerts nearby Court of Briars guards** 
> * Roll **2d6 under Dexterity** to navigate safely


### 2. The Pillars of Elfinkind

>[!tldr] Room Details
> * See: Four **pillars** carved in the dwarven style. Each depicts an elf (see below); plant growth.
> * Smell: **earthy**, **mildewed**, **rotten**.
> * Feel: Humidity; a gentle, cool, stale breeze from the north. 

The pillars in this room were gifts from the dwarves of the Titan's Teeth mountain range, given in commemoration of the fulfillment of an ancient oath. Each represents an elfin Paragon -- that is, an archetype that elves strive to embody in their day to day lives. Each pillar has a recess carved into it at about a meter up where an offering could fit.

The Paragons are as follows:

#### The Scholar
*A robed figure with arms tucked into sleeves. Scrolls are pinned between its arm and torso.* 
* **Accepted offering**: Texts containing ancient lore and secrets
* **Reward**: @todo
* **Frequency**: @todo

#### The Seneschal
*A finely dressed figure holding a delicate sabre, tip planted into its plinth.*
* **Accepted offering**: @todo
* **Reward**: @todo
* **Frequency**: @todo

#### The Survivor
*A muscular, stern-eyed survivalist. They stand at attention with a spear in one hand*
* **Accepted offering**: A +2 or better weapon
* **Reward**: A permanent +1 to hit and +1 damage with either missile or melee weapons, depending on the sacrificed weapon.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

#### The Spellweaver
*A robed figure clutching a staff.*
* **Accepted offering**: An arcane spell scroll of 4th level or higher
* **Reward**: A runic brand that confers a stronger connection with the Arcane.
    * A Magic-User, Elf, or Illusionist donor will gain an additional level 1 spell slot per day.
    * Others receive a single level 1 arcane spell slot that can only be used with a randomly rolled Magic-User spell.
* **Frequency**: Once per character

## Loot spread, from ChatGPT:
```
In the Basic/Expert Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, the distribution of loot in a dungeon is generally based on the challenge level of the creatures and encounters within it. More powerful and difficult encounters should yield better loot as a reward for the players.

In this particular dungeon, you could consider the following spread of loot:

-   Gold, jewelry, and gems: These could be found in a variety of locations, including the treasure hoard, the ancient burial chamber, and perhaps even the throne room. The amount of gold and treasure found should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Magic items: Magic items should be more rare and valuable, and could be found in locations such as the ritual chamber, the chamber of arcane power, and perhaps even hidden within traps or puzzles. The type and power of the magic items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    
-   Art objects and other valuable items: These could be found in locations such as the library, the throne room, and the ancient burial chamber. The value and rarity of these items should be based on the challenge level of the encounters in these areas.
    

It's important to keep in mind that the distribution of loot should be balanced and make sense within the context of the dungeon and its theme. Players should feel rewarded for their efforts, but the loot should also be challenging to obtain and fit within the story of the dungeon.
