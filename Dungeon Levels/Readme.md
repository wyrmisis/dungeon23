## Dungeon Overview

## Monthly Breakdown

### January

We'll spend January working on [[01 - Citadel, Ground Level]] and our workflow for the rest of the year. Much of my workflow was decided on in December, but we'll inevitably need to tweak it, since it's hard to know if something will work without the rubber hitting the road.

*Always write your first chapter last.*
We'll spend December on the surface level area and a final editing pass. With all other levels done, the surface can serve as a means to tie everything together and give access to the rest of the dungeon through shortcuts and traps.
