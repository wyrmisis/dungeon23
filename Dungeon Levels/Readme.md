## Dungeon Overview

Briarhedge Hall is an ancient elven fortification.  When we say "ancient", we typically speak from the human perspective: some one or two millennia old, lost to the sands of history. This place, however, is ancient even by the standards of its initial builders.

The result of collaboration between elves and dwarves, Briarhedge Hall is in remarkably good shape for a structure of its age. The Citadel, as it is colloquially known, has aged fairly gracefully, though it has been long abandoned by its elven masters for reasons that aren't entirely clear. If an event only happens if someone remembers it, then the history of the Citadel is a collective blank spot in the rich tapestry of elven history.

## Monthly Breakdown

### January

We'll spend January working on [[01 - Citadel, Ground Level]] and our workflow for the rest of the year. Much of my workflow was decided on in December, but we'll inevitably need to tweak it, since it's hard to know if something will work without the rubber hitting the road.

*Always write your first chapter last.*
We'll spend December on the surface level area and a final editing pass. With all other levels done, the surface can serve as a means to tie everything together and give access to the rest of the dungeon through shortcuts and traps.
