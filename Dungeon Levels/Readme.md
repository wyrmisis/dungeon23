This folder will contain notes for each dungeon level.

## Style Guide
Each floor should contain the following elements:
* The Level's map, using Leaflet
* The Level's overview
* Factions present on the level
* Random encounters for the level 

## Anatomy of a Room Key

A room key should look like the following...

### 00. Room Name (note: level 3 heading)
* List out immediately important **sensory** and **player-context** information 
* Terse, useful **descriptions**
* Be sure to emphasize **nouns** and **verbs** 

Optional longer form information, which can contain GM context; historical context for a room, tables, mechanics, and so on. Be sure to make good use of subheadings and other formatting tools.
> [!todo]

> [!question] Secret: some hidden object/door
> * Where is it?
> * How does it work?
> * If it's a cache/container/etc, what's in it?
> 
> A secret should have a d6 chance to be discovered through searching; if the discovery chance isn't d6, add the discovery chance die to the title

> [!danger] Trap: some trap name
> * Trap information with **scannable bolding**;
> * Where is it?
> * What does it do?
> * How is it triggered?
> * If the trap deals damage and/or requires a save, add that to the title (ex: `Lightning Trap (W: 3d8)` for a lightning trap that deals 3d8 on a failed Wands save)
> 
> If applicable, long-form information about the trap can be entered like this.

> [!example]  Treasure
> * A bulleted list of **treasure**
> * Be sure to bold **item names** (and link to them if necessary) 

> [!info] Inhabitants
> * A bulleted list of stat lines
> * Links to the bestiary if necessary
> 
> A room can have multiple inhabitant blocks; just add the condition for the extra slate of inhabitants to the title.
