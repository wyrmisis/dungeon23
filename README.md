(it feels a little self-indulgent to write an "official" sounding readme about my own project, but documentation is a good habit to stick to)

## Intent
This repository is intended to serve as an automated backup of my #Dungeon23 work.

This project will be a 11+ floor megadungeon themed around the decay of order into chaos, as well as perception and reality. My hope is to tap into cosmic and psychological horror -- I'm aiming for a more eldritch Silent Hill, as a contrast to more capable protagonists.

This dungeon will be designed and statted for games that follow the B/X lineage. The companion Foundry module will include stats and items for the Unofficial Old School Essentials system for Foundry (disclaimer: I'm a contributor to that project).

## Goals
The obvious goal of this project is to complete a full megadungeon, per the "rules" of #Dungeon23 -- one room a day, one floor a month.

In addition, I would like to have this dungeon fully ready to be imported into my VTT of choice, Foundry, so others can pick it up and use it with minimal prep or fuss when I'm done writing it.

Very little here is likely to be playtested; borrow this content at your own risk.
