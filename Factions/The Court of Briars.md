name: Thorned Bones

description: "The thorny animated remains of various living things, amalgamated into roughly humanoid-sized and -shaped beings through habitation by one of the Lady-Commander's snared souls. They are nodes in the Court's hivemind, but are incapable of independent thought. They follow simple commands, such as \"guard\" or \"patrol\". **Note**: the stats given here are for the bony vessel, not for the inhabiting soul."
