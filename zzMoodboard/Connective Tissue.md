How should dungeon levels be connected?

## Magical and Metaphysical
* **Unidirectional**: Unfinished rituals from previous inhabitants
* **Bidirectional**: Holes in reality; think Silent Hill 2 and 4.
* **Omnidirectional**: "Fast travel" nodes that require a material or verbal passkey
* **The Well**: A hole that appears to be an endless, bottomless void. The entire dungeon is oriented around it. When you reach a lower or higher level and observe the hole from said level, you can see up/down to levels you've observed the hole from previously. Consider this one lane of our "dungeon highway" for returning adventurers.
## Mundane
* **Ventilation shafts**, as deep as the Proving Grounds levels
* **Hand-dug' tunnels**, excavated by those looking to bypass the dangers of the first level
* **Architectural decay**, resulting in holes in the floor and rubble piles that lead to the ceiling
* **Burrowed tunnels**, created by whatever lives in the Wormway
