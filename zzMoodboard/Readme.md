This directory will contain resources and less structured ideation than the rest of the project; it's a dumping ground for whatever ideas I want to revisit in the future.

## Concept
* A ruined *elven citadel*, built atop a "nexus of arcane energies"
* A *proving ground* built beneath a symbol of elven might. Age has rendered much of the trial artifice inert at best, and significantly more dangerous at worst.
* A *network of tunnels* dug by aberrant subterranean horrors. Twisting and disorienting paths that could lead anywhere.
* An *arcane library* of a precursor people, long buried by time and calamity. Its instruments and machina still imitate a simulacrum of research, despite being corrupted by the very thing they were meant to drag to light.
* The *interface* between "us" and what lies beyond corporeality; a space for emissaries of Nothing to deliver doom-singing proclamations to hopeless hearts. *Platinum and glass* over the Void.
* A vast Nothing, the slow decay of corporeality until nothing but Void remains. It is *Hell*. It is *Empty*.
