## Themes
* Fading glory of storied people/cultures
* Entropy and decay
* "Old World Blues"
* Seeking our lost selves
* Becoming another person's mask

## Inspirations
* My own anxieties over losing the self to the withering of meat
* That one album that emulates the "feeling" of succumbing to dementia
    * I am not linking or listening to it again, that album leaves some marks.
* *Darkest Dungeon*'s march from dark fantasy adventure into mythos horror
* *Diablo*'s descent from the mundane/expected into the supernatural/religious
* *Cave Story*'s re-contextualization of itself after learning its hidden truths
* *Silent Hill*'s warping of personal, perceived reality
* The general design ethos of *The Halls of Arden Vul*
* Terse and usable room keys of published adventures for *Old School Essentials* and *Mausritter*
* *Signalis*'s intersection of the cosmic and the personal

## Flavors
* Action-Horror Fantasy (my usual)
* Hope and hopelessness
* Disorientation
* Sacrifice? Progress in this dungeon will cost something.
* When in doubt, tastefully screw with the players' bedrock assumptions
* Intentionally break reality and substitute it with internally consistent replacements.
